# Linux-Shell-In-C

This is a shell, written in C, that supports all the built-in commands that exist in the linux shell. 
It also supports pipelining of up to three commands. Written in one week, there are a lot of room for improvement
and better ways to organize the code (work in progress). 

To try it out:

please clone the repository to a local directory of your choice -> execute "make" in a terminal to produce an executable 
named "sshell" ->  type "./sshell" in terminal to start the shell.
